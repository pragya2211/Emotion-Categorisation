# Emotion Categorisation
It is an app made on psychopy to categorise the reaction of humans when exposed to various emotions.

## About the Experiment:

The experiment had two blocks: Block1 and Block2. In Block1, participants
had to guess if the shown face stimulus was happy or not. They had to
press the right arrow, if shown face was happy and left arrow, if it was not.
In the second block, participants were shown a face stimulus and they had
to press the ‘h’ key if the shown face was happy, ‘s’ key if the shown face
was sad and ‘a’ key, if the shown face was angry. The reaction time of the
participants for both the blocks was noted.

## Design of the Experiment:

- ‘+’ for 200 ms
- Face Stimulus for 80 ms
- Noise for 100 ms
- Blank Screen to report emotion: 2 seconds
